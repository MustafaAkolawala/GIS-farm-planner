**Description:** This Readme file explains all the attributes used in the soil dataset, the database is sourced from <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0356-3>. The database compiled data from a set of soil health measurements collected across 41 countries worldwide, including 5,241 data entries from 281 published studies. It includes several soil health indicators and background indicators that describe factors such as climate, elevation, and soil type. Our goal in using this database is to perform comprehensive analyses of soil health changes related to cropland conservation management. Further, we use it for planning and assessing farms based on several factors like climate change, soil type, terrain, depth of soil, elevation, etc.

The following columns were removed since they had alot of empty entries: 'ClimateType', 'ClayPerc', 'Tillage_C', 'Tillage_T', 'Weed_C', 'Weed_T'
The entries from following columns were removed to make the number of complete rows even among all the entries: Latitude, SiteInfor, GrainCropGroup, Elevation, GrainCrop, CoverCropGroup, CoverCrop, ControlDescription
